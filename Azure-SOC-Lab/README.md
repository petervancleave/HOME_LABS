# Microsoft Azure SOC Lab with Honeypot and Automated Threat Hunting 


Goal: Deploy a SOC environment that collects logs from a live honeypot, ingests them into Azure Sentinel for analysis, sets up automated alerts and queries, and includes a simple dashboard for incident response. Add DevOps pipelines to deploy/replicate the setup as well as network segmentation.


(note, add automated threat hunting with the apis from: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload and https://www.abuseipdb.com/ )
