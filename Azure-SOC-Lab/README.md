# SOC Lab with Hybrid Honeypot Integration and Automated Threat Hunting Built in Microsoft Azure



Goal: Deploy a SOC environment that collects logs from a live honeypot, ingests them into Azure Sentinel for analysis, sets up automated alerts and queries, and includes a simple dashboard for incident response. Add DevOps pipelines to deploy/replicate the setup and IT elements like network segmentation.
