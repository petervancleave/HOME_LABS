### Cost Management

Azure can get pricey, especially if you leave things running. However, using Azure for personal learning does not have to become expensive as long as you are managing costs and aware of usage. A preventative measure that can be taken to ensure costs do not balloon is configuring alert rules to alert about costs, and creating a monthly budget with a threshold of what you are willing to spend. 

You can navigate to Budgets by searching for it in the search bar.

Other tips to help with cost management include:

- Choose low cost regions like East US or West US 2
- Use spot instances or B1s VMs.
- Shut down VMs when they are not in use via Azure portal or commands (`az vm stop`).
- Monitor ingestion. 
- Delete resources that are no longer needed and at a project's end.
